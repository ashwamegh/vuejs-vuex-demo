# Jayway Vue.js 2.0 workshop

## NOTICE!

This repository is no longer maintained.
Because of security vulnerabilities in old versions of the vue cli and it's dependent packages I have removed all package.json files so the examples won't run anymore.

This is a visual Vue.js 2.0 workshop where you will be building an e-commerce application (Jaystore). Hopefully this workshop will give you a feel for how you can use different techniques depending on the size of your application and how to handle different challenges when a Vue.js 2.0 app evolves in size and complexity.
